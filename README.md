# SonyAlphaUSB

This (WIP) project aims to control Sony Alpha cameras via the USB connection on Windows. Sony A7 III is the only camera which has been tested so far.

## How it works

The Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) API is used to control the camera via USB in the exact same way that the Sony Imaging Edge software does.

## Disclaimer

Sony doesn't provide an official API for interacting with the USB protocol. Using this code is done at your own risk. Requests should be sent to the camera in a timely manner to avoid any issues.
